# Rivers

A web-based generative simulation playing with the formation and flow of waterways.

## Why?

As a challenge and a bit of fun. Like a river I have a starting point and will work out my path as I go.

## Usage

The project is compiled using Vite. All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server       |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally     |
