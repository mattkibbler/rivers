# Rivers

A web-based generative simulation playing with the formation and flow of waterways.

## Why?

As a challenge and a bit of fun. Like a river I have a starting point and will work out my path as I go.

## Demo

Take a look at the project in action:

| Version                | Demo Link       |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| v0.0.3 | https://mattkibbler.github.io/rivers/version-0.0.3/ |
| v0.0.2 | https://mattkibbler.github.io/rivers/version-0.0.2/ |
| v0.0.1 | https://mattkibbler.github.io/rivers/version-0.0.1/ |

## Roadmap

- [x] Add asynchronous tile generation
- [ ] Create backend service to generate and persist tiles
- [ ] Add zooming in/out
- [ ] Allow toggling between "windowed" and "fullscreen" modes
- [ ] Add less random, more coherent tile generation


## Usage

The project is compiled using Vite. All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server       |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally     |
